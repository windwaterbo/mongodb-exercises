# Aggregation - Multi-Field Join & One-to-Many

## Scenario

You want to generate a report to list all the orders made for each product in **2020**. To achieve this, you need to take a shop's **products collection** and join each product record to all its orders stored in an **orders collection**. There is a **1:many relationship** between both collections, based on a match of two fields on each side. Rather than joining on a single field like **product_id (which doesn't exist in this data set)**, you need to use two common fields to join (**product_name** and **product_variation**). Note that the requirement to **perform a 1:many join** does not mandate the need to join by multiple fields on each side of the join. However, in this example, it has been deemed beneficial to show both of these aspects in one place.

## Sample Data 

- products collection

```js
db.products.insertMany([
  {
    "name": "Asus Laptop",
    "variation": "Ultra HD",
    "category": "ELECTRONICS",
    "description": "Great for watching movies",
  },
  {
    "name": "Asus Laptop",
    "variation": "Normal Display",
    "category": "ELECTRONICS",
    "description": "Good value laptop for students",
  },
  {
    "name": "The Day Of The Triffids",
    "variation": "1st Edition",
    "category": "BOOKS",
    "description": "Classic post-apocalyptic novel",
  },
  {
    "name": "The Day Of The Triffids",
    "variation": "2nd Edition",
    "category": "BOOKS",
    "description": "Classic post-apocalyptic novel",
  },
  {
    "name": "Morphy Richards Food Mixer",
    "variation": "Deluxe",
    "category": "KITCHENWARE",
    "description": "Luxury mixer turning good cakes into great",
  },
  {
    "name": "Karcher Hose Set",
    "variation": "Full Monty",
    "category": "GARDEN",
    "description": "Hose + nosels + winder for tidy storage",
  },
]); 
```

- create index for the orders collection

```js
db.orders.createIndex({"product_name": 1, "product_variation": 1});
```

- orders collection

```js
db.orders.insertMany([
  {
    "customer_id": "elise_smith@myemail.com",
    "orderdate": ISODate("2020-05-30T08:35:52Z"),
    "product_name": "Asus Laptop",
    "product_variation": "Normal Display",
    "value": NumberDecimal("431.43"),
  },
  {
    "customer_id": "tj@wheresmyemail.com",
    "orderdate": ISODate("2019-05-28T19:13:32Z"),
    "product_name": "The Day Of The Triffids",
    "product_variation": "2nd Edition",
    "value": NumberDecimal("5.01"),
  },  
  {
    "customer_id": "oranieri@warmmail.com",
    "orderdate": ISODate("2020-01-01T08:25:37Z"),
    "product_name": "Morphy Richards Food Mixer",
    "product_variation": "Deluxe",
    "value": NumberDecimal("63.13"),
  },
  {
    "customer_id": "jjones@tepidmail.com",
    "orderdate": ISODate("2020-12-26T08:55:46Z"),
    "product_name": "Asus Laptop",
    "product_variation": "Normal Display",
    "value": NumberDecimal("429.65"),
  },
]);
```

## Aggregation Pipeline

Define a pipeline ready to perform the aggregation:

```js
var pipeline = [
  // Join by 2 fields in in products collection to 2 fields in orders collection
  {"$lookup": {
    "from": "orders",
    "let": {
      "prdname": "$name",
      "prdvartn": "$variation",
    },
    // Embedded pipeline to control how the join is matched
    "pipeline": [
      // Join by two fields in each side
      {"$match":
        {"$expr":
          {"$and": [
            {"$eq": ["$product_name",  "$$prdname"]},
            {"$eq": ["$product_variation",  "$$prdvartn"]},            
          ]},
        },
      },

      // Match only orders made in 2020
      {"$match": {
        "orderdate": {
          "$gte": ISODate("2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
          "$lt": ISODate("2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
        }
      }},
      
      // Exclude some unwanted fields from the right side of the join
      {"$unset": [
        "_id",
        "product_name",
        "product_variation",
      ]},
    ],
    as: "orders",
  }},

  // Only show products that have at least one order
  {"$match": {
    "orders": {"$ne": []},
  }},

  // Omit unwanted fields
  {"$unset": [
    "_id",
  ]}, 
];
```

# Execution

Execute the aggregation using the defined pipeline and also view its explain plan:

```js
db.products.aggregate(pipeline);

db.products.explain("executionStats").aggregate(pipeline);
```
